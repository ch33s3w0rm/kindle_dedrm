kindle_dedrm: Python 2.x script for removing DRM from Kindle and .prc e-books

To use, install Python 2.x (recommended: 2.7, 2.6 or 2.5), download the
kindle_dedrm script from here:
https://github.com/ch33s3w0rm/kindle_dedrm/raw/master/release/kindle_dedrm
, and run it in the command-line. There is no graphical user interface.

Compatible with Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and any operating system Python 2.x
runs on.

For maximum speed, use Python 2.7, 2.6, 2.5 or 2.4 (the latter with the
ctypes extension installed) on Linux, Mac OS X or Windows, on i386 (x86) or
amd64 (x86_64). You also get maximum speed with Python 2.4 on Linux i386,
because the dl module is used.

To use it with Python 2.5 or 2.4 or Windows, you have to unzip the
kindle_dedrm script first.
